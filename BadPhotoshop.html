        <h2>Project Decsription</h2>
        <p>
          This assignment utilized Photoshop to create distorted still 
          life images inspired by the artists Lucas Blalock
          and Daniel Gordon. Tools and functions used for this project 
          include the transform, copy, paste, masking,
          warp, and pen tools to create non-traditional artworks.
          <br />
          I didn't run into challenges using Photoshop for this project, 
          but I did struggle to think of interesting
          compositions. My digital art prior to this course had a large 
          focus on neatness and realism, I hadn't
          experimented with more expressionistic concepts, so it was 
          difficult for me to feel confident in my ideas.
          However, after overcoming this I felt like I'd done an excellent 
          job in recreating the style of Lucas Blalock.

        <h2>Bad Photoshop #1</h2>
        <p>
          The first image was created by photographing a still life of a
          bouquet of lego flowers. Then, I increased the
          size of the bouquet by copying and pasting flowers on top of 
          each other. I decided this was not enough
          distortion, so I used the same method to add two more bouquets 
          layered behind the first one. After this, the
          background felt empty, so I added flowers symetrically around 
          the bouquet. I wanted to make sure the bouquets
          aren't perfectly cut out, making the distortion more clear to 
          the viewer.

        <h2>Bad Photoshop #2</h2>
        <p>
          The second image was created by warping the pile of yarn, then 
          copying and pasting crochet hooks as a
          geometric border around the image. I decided to create a geometric 
          spiral around the top right corner. Then, I
          used the pen tool to add low opacity circles of color to the 
          image, creating more visual interest.

        <h2>Bad Photoshop #3</h2>
        <p>
          The third image was created by photographing my computer setup, 
          and taking various pictures of my hands. I
          added an image of a static screen to the monitor, then made a 
          masking layer of my keyboard, warping it and
          using it as a border for the image. I then added hands reaching 
          towards the center of the screen, adding color
          and overlay effects to match the color scheme of the work.
